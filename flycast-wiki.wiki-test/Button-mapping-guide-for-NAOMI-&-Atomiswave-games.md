# What is this supposed to be?
This contains info related about what are the control mappings for each NAOMI/Atomiswave game. While flycast has an option to see Arcade button names (Button 1-8, Service, Coin, Test, etc), what each of these buttons do can vary depending of what arcade game are you playing, which is why this is here. Note that the DC name equivalents to the Arcade buttons are only provided for reference; mind that most of the time this will mean that the configurations set to an DC controller by default will feel weird when playing NAOMI games, and viceversa.

Also, all of these games should use D-Pad for movement, unless stated otherwise (for example, the analog axises being mentioned for steering/moving on the table; or another input method being used).

This applies to:
* Capcom VS. SNK Millenium Fight 2000
* Capcom VS. SNK Millenium Fight 2000 Pro
* Marvel VS. Capcom 2
* NeoGeo Battle Coliseum
* The King of Fighters Neowave

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Button 1      | Light Punch   | A  |

Note that almost all of the games actually use Button 3 and Button 6, except that their use depends of the game. It goes like the following:

| Game        | Mapping       | Button  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Marvel VS. Capcom 2      | Assist 1   | Button 3  |
| Marvel VS. Capcom 2      | Assist 2   | Button 6  |
| NeoGeo Battle Coliseum    | Change Partner | Button 3  |
| The King of Fighters XI    | Knockdown   | Button 3  |
| The Rumble Fish      | Dodge   | Button 3  |
| The Rumble Fish 2    | Dodge   | Button 3  |

## 6-button fighting games
This applies to:
* Capcom VS SNK 2
* Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Button 1      | Light Punch   | A  |
| Button 2      | Medium Punch  | B  |
| Button 3      | Strong Punch  | X  |
| Button 4      | Light Kick    | Y  |
| Button 5      | Medium Kick   | Right DPad Up  |
| Button 6      | Strong Kick   | Right DPad Down  |


## Racing games
Tested with the following games:
* Crazy Taxi
* Faster Than Speed
* Maximum Speed

Note that Atomiswave games (e.g. Maximum Speed) need initial calibration through Test Menu for steering to work properly. To do so: in the Service mode, select Test Mode and choose I/O Test (follow the instructions as shown).

In the case of Crazy Taxi, Gear Up/Down is for Acceleration and Reverse Gear, respectively.

| Button/Axis   | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Stick X | Steering   | Stick X   |
| Right Trigger | Accelerate   | Right Trigger   |
| Left Trigger  | Reverse | Left Trigger  |
| Up | Gear Up   | D-Pad Up   |
| Down  | Gear Down | D-Pad Down |


## Light-gun games
Tested on House of The Dead 2 so far. You can play as the mouse acting as an light-gun by setting Port A or B to "Light-Gun" and having the mouse set to either. Left Click fires, while Right Click reloads.

Some games like 'Maze of the Kings' might need initial calibration of the lightgun when running it for the first time.

## Keyboard games
The following games require a keyboard to play:
* Lupin the 3rd: The Typing
* La Keyboard
* The Typing of the Dead

The emulator should automatically use an inserted keyboard to emulate the game. It is recommended that you unbind your keyboard (Port: None) to avoid keyboard mappings interfering with the keyboard emulation itself.

## Alien Front
Note that if you present issues with the steering being stuck to the right, that's because you need to go to Test Mode > Game Test Mode > Input Calibration and calibrate the axis. After that, it should work fine.

(NOTE for RA users: DIV matching must be disabled for the game to run properly.)

| Button/Axis        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Stick X | Steering   | Stick X   |

| Button 1      | Secondary Weapon   | A  |
| Button 4      | Strafe Left  | Y  |
| Button 2      | Strafe Right  | B  |

## Cannon Spike
Note that, unlike the Dreamcast version, you need to press buttons simultaneously to do Heavy Shot (Fire + Lock), Heavy Shot (Attack + Lock), and Special Attack (All three buttons).

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Button 1      | Fire   | A  |

This applies to:
* Guilty Gear X (this game doesn't use Button 5)
* Guilty Gear X Ver 1.5 (this game doesn't use Button 5)
* Guilty Gear Isuka
* Guilty Gear XX and all variations.

Note that the control mappings for these games actually can be changed internally through the test mode to use an different button arrangement.

## Gun Survivor 2
The game uses 3 axises instead of 2: Moving forward/backwards, strafing left/right, and turning left/right.

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Left Stick X | Yaw (Turning)   | Left Stick X   |
| Left Stick Y | Pitch (Moving)   | Left Stick Y   |
| Right Stick X | Roll (Starfing)   | Right Stick X   |
| Button 1      | Gun Button (Orange)  | A  |
| Button 2      | Gun Trigger (Fire)  | B  |

## Monkey Ball
This one is here for completion, as you only use the Analog Stick (and the only button used is the Start button, which you need to use to begin in first place).

| Button/Axis   | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Stick X/Y | Joystick   | Stick X/Y   |

This applies to:
* Akatsuki Blitzkampf (this game doesn't use Buttons 4 and 5)
* Melty Blood Act Cadenza (Ver. A/B1/B2)
* Melty Blood Actress Again

| Button 5      | Button E (A+B+C/Macro)  | Right DPad Up  

## Outtrigger
Outtrigger works with using the button mappings in Port A for an standard controller, and aiming is controlled with the mouse. Light-Gun needs to be enabled in Port B, or else the mouse won't aim.

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Button 1      | Fire  | A  |
| Button 2      | Change Weapon  | B  |
| Button 3      | Jump  | X  |

## Samba de Amigo
The two sticks act as the maracas (you move them to where you want), and the buttons act as when you swing the maracas (in other words, you have to press the button to hit the notes).

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Button 1      | Left Maraca Swing/Button  | A  |
| Button 2      | Right Maraca Swing/Button  | B  |
| Left Stick | Left Maraca   | Left Stick    |
| Right Stick  | Right Maraca  | Right Stick    |

## Wave Runner GP
The game uses 4 axises instead of 2: Accel/Throttle, Steering, Pitch and Roll. The most important ones are Throttle and Steering, as it is not clear yet about what Pitch/Roll values are used for here.

Note that the setup involves that the Throttle axis is like an handlebar, so center is actually like an half-way throttle; you will need to push it to one way to Brake/stop Throttling (which is needed to select the other 2 courses instead of auto-selecting the first one), and push it to the other way to full Throttle.

| Button        | Mapping       | DC name equivalent  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|---------------------|
| Left Stick X | Steeting   | Left Stick X   |
| Left Stick Y | Throttle/Accel   | Left Stick Y   |
| Right Stick X | Roll  | Right Stick X   |
| Right Stick Y | Pitch    | Right Stick Y   |
| Up | View Button   | D-Pad Up   |
