## What is this?
This is an unofficial (for now) wiki/guide made to help users to use the Flycast emulator.

## What not to do.
* * **Demand Features**
* * **Ask before you look or read** *(Most issues are documented and solved, and while we are ALWAYS willing to help, you *MUST* try your self, as "How Do I Play A Game" at this point is just silly lol)
* * **Be Toxic**

## What is Flycast?
Flycast is the #1 rated, Free, Open sourced, Multi platform Dreamcast emulator that can run MULIPLE systems, and has more features and a higher compatibility then any other Dreamcast Emulator out there currently.

## What devices can I play on?

What devices **CAN'T** you play on...? Something that Flyinghead prides himself on is the seamless transition across platforms. Flycast has all features on all distros, and is kept very consistent. The following systems could use some tweaking to get the best experience from them, but they are as follows;

* * **Windows**
* * **Linux**
* * **IOS**
* * **ANDROID**
* * **Switch**
* * **Xbox**
* * **Libretro Core**

Flycast has a wonderful feature, **Sorting Method** , which allows you to play flycast less accurately and easier to render, and in MOST cases this works just fine, sometimes it can cause GFX issues, but to get it running on very low end devices, with some gfx issues is better then not at all :)


## What does Flycast run?
Flycast supports the following:
* SEGA Dreamcast games (CHD, CDI, GDI, CUE) including games based on Windows CE
* SEGA NAOMI/NAOMI2 games (.zip, .7z)
* SEGA NAOMI/NAOMI2 GD-ROM games (.zip, .7z with .chd)
* Sammy Atomiswave games (.zip, .7z)
* Decrypted NAOMI games (.bin, not recommended)

## What doesn't flycast run?
Doesn't support SEGA Hikaru (yet).

## Does it have command-line support?
It can open games through drag-and-dropping over the .exe file, using an batch file or through the command-line. For example, if you have an Marvel VS. Capcom 2 ROM at the root Flycast folder and you have an flycast.exe file, if you type `flycast.exe mvsc2.zip` on the command-line, flycast should open with Marvel VS Capcom 2 booting; as long as you have the NAOMI BIOS installed.

In any case, it is recommended to check [this page](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/wiki/Configuration-files-and-command-line-parameters#launching-game-from-command-linebatch) for more information about using command-line parameters to load games, as well as do things like starting the emulator in fullscreen and/or with certain settings enabled.

## How can I start the emulator in full-screen mode?
Just set it in full-screen (by pressing Alt+Enter or F11), and if you close the emulator while fullscreen, the next time it will open in fullscreen.

## Can it connect online?
Most if not all games compatible with [Dreamcast Live servers](https://www.dreamcastlive.net/games) are supported by flycast, and the emulator is automatically configured to use Dreamcast Live servers. With DCnet thou, just turning it on in your **Network Settings** will allow you to play native online games with others around the world. (Check the DCnet page for current supported games)
