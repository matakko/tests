# Extras? What extras?
You see, sometimes arcade games have certain features or unlockables that need to be enabled with an password through the test menu, or are time-enabled (need to have the machine powered or boot the machine an amount of times). However, as these games are emulated, you can actually use an savedata/eeprom file from someone else that has already enabled said unlockables. In this case, there will be some few savedata files provided for certain games that have extras unlocked.

All of these should go inside the data folder at the root of flycast's folder, since that's where EEPROM/saves get stored.

### [Cannon Spike/GunSpike (cspike)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/cspike.zip.eeprom)
Initially, B.B. Hood and Mega Man were unavailable to play for some reason (unlike in the DC version which gave the player the option to select them without unlocking anything). This save has both characters enabled, as well as Cammy's alternate outfit (by pressing Up while highlighting her on character select screen), without any coins or records registered into it.

### [Capcom VS. SNK Millenium Fight 2000 (capsnk)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/capsnk.zip.eeprom) **[USA Region]**
All EX characters and Ratio 4 characters (Akuma, Evil Ryu, Iori) unlocked.
Outside of that, it's an clean save, without any coins or records registered.

Note that the unlocks on this save only seem to work if the Region is set to USA; and these may reset if the game is loaded with another region. Saves for the other regions may be provided if necessary or requested.

### [Faster than Speed (ftspeed)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/ftspeed.zip.nvmem)
Enables the previously locked Type X, XI and XII cars. Those might be useful for the difficult tracks. No coins nor records registered, plus that none of the other settings were changed in this save, except that you only need one coin to play instead of three.

### [Marvel VS. Capcom 2 (mvsc2)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/mvsc2.zip.eeprom)
All 56 characters avaliable from the beginning, machine registered on Level 84 (USA) after using the 4 USA passwords.
Outside of that, it's an clean save, without any coins or records registered.

### [Metal Slug 6 (mslug6)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/mslug6.zip.nvmem)
[Second nvmem file](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/mslug6.zip.nvmem2)

NVRAM for Metal Slug 6 with Red Blood enabled, which can't be done through test menu normally. If it doesn't work with just using the first .nvmem file, try using both .nvmem files (the first and the second one).

### [NeoGeo Battle Colliseum (ngbc)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/ngbc.zip.nvmem)
All characters unlocked, which required the machine to be active for at least 74 days since power-on. No coins nor records registered.

### [Power Stone 2 (pstone2)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/pstone2.zip.eeprom)
All time-release items and secret character Pride unlocked. No coins nor records registered.

### [Project Justice / Moero Justice Gakuen (pjustic)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/pjustic.zip.eeprom)
All characters unlocked. No coins nor records registered.

### [The King of Fighters XI (kofxi)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/kofxi.zip.nvmem)
All extra characters available (Adelheid, Gyazu, Silver, Gai and Hayate). The method used to unlock them is similar to the one in NeoGeo Battle Colliseum, requiring a certain amount of days after power-on. No coins nor records registered.

### [The Rumble Fish 2 (rumblef2)](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/savedatas/rumblef2.zip.nvmem)
Extra characters Greed, Hazama and Beatrice (which only can be selected with an character code if the other two are already enabled) and extra modes Time Attack and Survival unlocked. No coins nor records registered.

To play as Beatrice, move the cursor to Hazama, then press Upx4, Rightx2, Downx4, Leftx2, and finally Down. To play Time Attack mode, hold both punch buttons and then press Start at the Title Screen. To play Survival mode, do the same but holding both kick buttons instead.
