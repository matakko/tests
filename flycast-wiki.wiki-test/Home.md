# Welcome to the flycast wiki!

![](https://github.com/TheArcadeStriker/flycast-wiki/blob/master/images/flycast-wiki%20banner.png)
This wiki/guide is in development, which will be made to documentate the functions of Flycast, and allow beginners as well as advanced users to know everything they need to use this excellent emulator!

On the sidebar, you can check out how to get started with using Flycast, read the Frequently Asked Questions, or read about useful information related to more advanced features.

If you're here from the recent Flycast beta rollback update, you can check Shiburizu's guide about all you need to know to try it [right here](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/User:Shiburizu/Flycast-GGPO) (and thank you for the shoutout to this wiki!)
