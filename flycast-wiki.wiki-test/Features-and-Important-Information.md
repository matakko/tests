# Important Information
There are certain situations that may be confusing to understand when using Flycast for first time, as well as some few questions that may be around your head, like how to know if you are using the right ROMs for NAOMI/Atomiswave games (if it does tell you there are missing files), how to configure controls for certain NAOMI/Atomiswave games, how to connect to the internet, if it is possible to unlock everything in certain NAOMI games, etc. For that, there is info in the following pages; some are still in construction and ideally there would be some more additional info later on, but at the moment the current resources can be useful for certain needs:
